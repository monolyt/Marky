## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/monolyt/marky.git
```
### 2. Navigate into the `marky`directory:
```bash
cd marky
```
### 3. Fill out the `bookmarks.json` file:
The bookmarks.json file holds all of your bookmarks. Before hosting, youâ€™ll need to customize this file with your own bookmarks. Each entry in bookmarks.json should have the following structure:
```json
[
{
    "title": "Example Bookmark",
    "description": "A description of the link",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "tags": ["example", "bookmark"]
},
{
    "title": "Another Bookmark",
    "description": "A different description",
    "url": "https://anotherexample.com",
    "tags": ["another", "example"]
}
]
```
- title: The name of the bookmark as it will appear in the list.
- description: A brief description of what the link is about.
- url: The link itself.
- tags: A list of tags to categorize and search for the bookmark (e.g., "news", "tech").
Add as many bookmark entries as needed following this structure; they don't need to be in alphabetical order - the script sorts them by default.
### 4. Host the folder on a static web server (e.g. Netlify)
Once deployed, Netlify will provide a unique URL for your site. This URL is random and therefor (relatively) private. It's publicly accessible, which enables you to access it on mobile as well.
